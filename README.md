# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

Users can save their own list of short URLs and provide the links to others online.

TinyApp will keep track of how many times the link is clicked and how many times the link is clicked by a unique user (so no cheating).
